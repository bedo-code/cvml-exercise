## Deduplication of textual content 

### Problem Statement
I have a directory that contains more than 20000 text, html and pdf files. I want to:
- Identify duplicates not by filename but raw contents of file, only keep the unique files
- Extend the finding duplicates across html/text/pdf

### Steps and Explanation  

1. **Identify Duplicates by Raw Content**  
   - Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., `SHA-256`) to compute hashes of the file contents. Identical hashes mean identical contents.
   - Maintain a set of unique hashes and track file paths.
   - Delete duplicate files based on content hash.

2. **Extend Duplicate Detection Across HTML, Text, and PDF**  
   - Normalize the content of different file formats to text. For example:
     - **Text Files:** Read content directly.
     - **HTML Files:** Use a library like `BeautifulSoup` to extract and normalize plain text.
     - **PDF Files:** Use a library like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer` to extract text content.
   - Use the normalized text to calculate hashes and identify duplicates across formats.  


### Key Notes  
1. **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling for file reading and parsing, especially for malformed files.  
2. **Performance Optimization:** For large directories, consider multithreading or parallel processing to speed up file processing.  
3. **Backup:** Always back up files before running deletion scripts to prevent accidental loss.  
4. **Logging:** Implement logging to track duplicate removals and potential issues during execution.  

These programs will allow you to effectively identify and remove duplicate files based on their content across multiple formats.
