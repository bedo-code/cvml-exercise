## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages: praw, tweepy, linkedin_api (automatically installed if missing)
- API credentials for each platform

## üìù Configuration

Create a `config.txt` file with your search parameters:

```
topic=artificial intelligence
start_date=2023-01-01
end_date=2023-12-31
scrape_reddit=true
scrape_twitter=true
scrape_linkedin=true
```

Set up your credentials either as environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
export REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username
export REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password
# Add similar entries for Twitter and LinkedIn
```

Or create a `credentials.json` file:

```json
{
  "reddit_client_id": "your_client_id",
  "reddit_client_secret": "your_client_secret",
  "reddit_username": "your_username",
  "reddit_password": "your_password",
  "twitter_bearer_token": "your_bearer_token",
  "twitter_consumer_key": "your_consumer_key",
  "twitter_consumer_secret": "your_consumer_secret",
  "twitter_access_token": "your_access_token",
  "twitter_access_token_secret": "your_access_token_secret",
  "linkedin_username": "your_email",
  "linkedin_password": "your_password"
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python socMedScraper.py -c config.txt -o results.json
```

## üß† Applications for Machine Learning Researchers

### 1. Cross-Platform Discourse Analysis
Track how topics evolve and spread across different social platforms. Identify which platforms lead in topic introduction and how narratives transform as they cross platform boundaries.

### 2. Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis
Build models that combine text, engagement metrics, and platform context to create more nuanced sentiment analysis tools that understand platform-specific communication patterns.

### 3. Public Response to Scientific Publications
Track how scientific papers are discussed across platforms after publication. Measure public sentiment, identify misunderstandings, and analyze how scientific communication could be improved.

### 4. Topic Evolution Visualization
Create dynamic visualizations showing how discussions around specific topics (like AI ethics or climate science) evolve over time across different platforms and communities.

### 5. Trend Prediction Systems
Develop early warning systems for emerging trends by analyzing cross-platform data patterns. Find signals that predict which topics might spread beyond niche communities to mainstream awareness.

### 6. Influence Network Mapping
Identify key influencers across platforms and visualize how information flows through cross-platform networks during emerging events or discussions.

### 7. Context-Aware LLM Training
Create platform-specific training data for fine-tuning language models to better understand the unique linguistic patterns and contexts of different social media platforms.

## üìä Example Research Projects

- "Cross-Platform Discourse on Climate Change: A Comparative Analysis of Expert vs. Public Communication"
- "Predicting Research Impact: Social Media Mentions as Early Indicators of Scientific Paper Citations"
- "Platform-Specific Semantic Drift: How Technical Terms Change Meaning Across Social Media Ecosystems"
- "Temporal Dynamics of Public Response to AI Advancement Announcements"

## üìö Ethical Considerations

This tool is designed for academic research purposes. Users should:
- Respect platform Terms of Service
- Consider privacy implications and anonymize data when appropriate
- Obtain IRB approval when necessary for human subjects research
- Consider the bias implications of platform-specific demographic skews
