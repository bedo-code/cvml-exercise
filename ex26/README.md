# Logo Tracker: A Comparative Study in Python and C++

Welcome to the **Logo Tracker** project! This repository provides an implementation of a logo detection and tracking system in both **Python** and **C++**. The project is designed to be a practical resource for computer vision graduate students who want to explore the differences between Python and C++ in the context of real-time object tracking. Whether you're interested in feature-based detection (ORB) or deep learning-based approaches (Lightweight DETR), this project has something for you.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to detect and track a logo in a video stream. The system uses two main approaches:
1. **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**: A feature-based detection method that matches keypoints between a reference logo image and the video frames.
2. **Lightweight DETR**: A deep learning-based approach using a pre-trained DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model for logo detection.

The Python implementation is designed for quick prototyping and ease of use, while the C++ version is optimized for performance and minimal dependencies. Both versions use the **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)** algorithm for tracking detected logos across frames.

## 🧠 **Why This Project?**

As a computer vision graduate student, you're likely familiar with Python's ease of use and rapid prototyping capabilities. However, when it comes to deploying real-time systems, C++ is often the language of choice due to its performance and efficiency. This project provides a unique opportunity to:
- **Compare Python and C++ implementations** of the same computer vision task.
- **Understand the trade-offs** between ease of development and performance.
- **Experiment with different tracking algorithms** (e.g., SORT) and detection methods (e.g., ORB, DETR).

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Python Version**
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python logoTracker.py -v <video_path> -i <logo_image_path> -o <output_video_path> -a <algorithm>
   ```
   - `<algorithm>`: `0` for ORB, `1` for Lightweight DETR.

### **C++ Version**
1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
2. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./LogoTracker <video_path> <logo_image_path> <output_video_path>
   ```
