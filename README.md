# Base repository for CV/ML exercises
This repository contains interesting Computer Vision and Machine Learning problems I have encountered while being in the industry.
Each problem is formulated at its core level to encourage first principles thinking. The following structure is maintained to design 
a potential solution to a given problem.

### Problem design  
This section involves defining the objectives, constraints, and scope of the project. It sets the foundation by identifying 
what needs to be solved, the expected outputs, and the criteria for success. This section ensures clarity and alignment 
with the project's goals by breaking down complex problems into manageable components.

### Data Preparation  
Data preparation entails collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis or modeling. 
This stage involves handling missing values, transforming data formats, and feature engineering to enhance the dataset's 
quality and relevance, ensuring reliable and meaningful results.

### Code Organization  
This section describes how to  structure the codebase in a clear, maintainable, and scalable manner. This includes using modular 
functions, adhering to coding standards, and separating concerns by grouping related functionalities. A well-organized codebase 
facilitates collaboration and future enhancements.

### Test cases  
Test cases are designed to validate the correctness and reliability of the code. They include a variety of scenarios, ranging 
from typical use cases to edge cases, to ensure that the program behaves as expected under different conditions. This step 
helps identify bugs and maintain quality assurance.

### Further Optimizations and improvements  
Further optimizations and improvements focus on refining the solution to enhance efficiency, scalability, and user experience. 
This includes performance tuning, algorithm refinement, and incorporating feedback for iterative enhancements, ensuring the 
solution remains effective and robust over time.
