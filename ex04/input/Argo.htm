          Based on the May 2007 "Wired" magazine article
          entitled "The Great Escape" by Joshuah Bearman;
          and chapter nine of the book entitled
          "The Master of Disguise" by Antonio Mendez.

</b>          The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP.
          After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
          It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.

<b>          1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1
</b>
          Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
          chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!� Fists in the
          air.

<b>          SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
</b>          YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.
          PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
          were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
          Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH� -- JUSTICE
          FOR MURDER.� A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
          bystanders than peacekeepers.
          A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
          An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.

<b>          2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2
</b>
          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

<b>          3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3
</b>
          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

</b>          Ladies and gentlemen, from the
          flight-deck. We're looking at a
          brief delay -- 
          Passengers groan a bit as they read paperbacks or
          International Herald Tribunes. Mark Lijek's arm is
          around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his mouth in what
          looks like a prayer. Kathy Stafford's fingers shake as
          she holds an arm rest. J Stafford tries to stay her
          hand.
          Mendez is sitting looking out the window toward the
          terminal.

<b>          300 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FLIGHT GATE - MORNING 300
</b>
          Azizi yells to the Swissair Rep, dragging her back toward
          the gate. We can't hear what she says back, but she's
          shaking her head.

<b>          301 INT. SWISSAIR DC-10 COCKPIT - MORNING 301
</b>
          From the window, we can see a GROUND CREWMAN give a
          thumbs-up. The scrubbed Swiss PILOT, 50s, gives a thumbs-
          up back.
          He gently releases the throttle lever.

<b>          302 INT. SWISSAIR DC-10 - MORNING 302
</b>
          Mendez and the Houseguests feel the plane start to move.

<b>          303 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - MORNING 303
</b>
          Azizi gs to the WINDOW. He can see the Swissair plane
          slowly backing onto the runway.
          He picks up a walkie and pushes through the flight gate
          door, setting off an alarm, followed by the three other
          Komiteh.
          He reaches the METAL BARS outside and can't get past.
          He CALLS INTO THE WALKIE.

<b>          304 INT. MEHRABAD FLIGHT TOWER - MORNING 304
</b>
          An Iranian FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER calmly speaks into
          his radio in British-accented English.

<b>          FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
</b>          SwissAir 363, you are Number 2 for
          departure.

<b>          305 INT. SWISSAIR DC-10 - MORNING 305

          Out the window of the plane. Two IRANIAN POLICE CARS and
          a CANVAS-TOPPED TRUCK are headed down the runway toward
          the plane.

<b>          307 EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - MORNING 307
</b>
          An IRAN AIRLINES 747 takes off, revealing the Swissair
          jet behind it. Only empty runway ahead of Swissair 363
          now and --

</b>
          We're SPEEDING BEHIND two Iranian police cars and a
          canvas-topped TRUCK as they speed toward the Swissair
          plane. In the back of the truck we can see half a dozen
          Komiteh, weapons drawn and --

          The Flight Traffic Controller moves his head-set mic away
          from his mouth to take a drink of very strong Iranian
          tea, and -- the door to the Control Room BURSTS OPEN.
          Three Komiteh with automatics, shouting instructions to
          the Traffic Controller, who spills his tea --

          The Flight Controller has his arms up... THROUGH the
          floor-to-ceiling windows of the tower, as three Komiteh
          watch a Swissair DC-10 angle upward and leave the
